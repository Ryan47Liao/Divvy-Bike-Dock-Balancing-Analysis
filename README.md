# Divvy-Bike-Dock-Balancing-Analysis
As peopleâ€™s usage of traditional commuting plumed since the onset of covid, bike-sharing services such as divvy have become increasingly popular. Demand for bikes are not evenly distributed, this leads to either bike shortage or lack of empty docks. This individual project visualized this challenge and proposed a solution to the problem.
